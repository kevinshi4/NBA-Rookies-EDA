# INFO332-Project-NBA-Rookies

This project analyzes NBA rookie performance statistics from 1980 to 2020. The primary goal is to identify patterns in rookie year data and determine which statistical indicators are associated with a player eventually becoming an NBA All-Star.

The project involves:
1.  **Data Collection:** Gathering rookie performance data, Hall of Fame status, and All-Star selection history from multiple CSV files.
2.  **Data Cleaning and Joining:** Merging these datasets, handling missing values, and performing necessary transformations to create a unified dataset for analysis. Player names (sometimes in conjunction with draft year) are used for joining datasets.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Generating descriptive statistics and visualizations to explore trends, compare All-Stars vs. Non-All-Stars across various metrics, and understand the data distributions.
4.  **Predictive Modeling:** Building a Random Forest model to predict whether a rookie will become an All-Star based on their rookie season performance statistics.
5.  **Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using a confusion matrix and examining feature importance.

## Scripts and Folders Explained

* **`raw_data/`**: This directory holds the raw input datasets used by the project.
    * `nba_rookie_data_1980-2016.csv`
    * `nba_rookie_hof_data_1980-2016.csv`
    * `nba_rookie_data_1979-2020.csv`
    * `nba_all_star_data_1980-2022.csv`

* **`scripts/`**: This directory contains all the R scripts used for data processing, analysis, and modeling.
    * **`data_cleaning_joining_script.R`**
    * **`descriptive_statistics.R`**
    * **`modeling.R`**
    * **`nba_comparative_analysis.R`**

* **`images/`**: This directory stores all the plots and charts generated by the `descriptive_statistics.R`, `modeling.R`, and `nba_comparative_analysis.R` scripts.

* **`nba_rookie_data_cleaned.csv`**: This CSV file is the main output of the `data_cleaning_joining_script.R`. It represents the consolidated and cleaned dataset used for all subsequent analysis and modeling.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have R and RStudio installed.
2.  Set your working directory to the root of this project.
3.  Install necessary R packages (listed within the scripts, e.g., `readr`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`, `patchwork`, `randomForest`, `caret`, `stringi`).
4.  Place the raw CSV files into the `raw_data/` directory.
5.  Run the scripts in the `scripts/` folder, typically starting with `data_cleaning_joining_script.R`, followed by the analysis or modeling scripts.
